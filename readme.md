# Execute Ownership command for Shadowmere, for TESIV Oblivion - Remastered
# A mod to Set shadowmere ownership to the player

### I had a bug in my savefile which make i lose shadowmere's ownership, even when i finished dark brotherhoodÂ´s questiline, so i wrote this mod to aways set shadowmere's ownership to me when i load a save file, a quick and easy fix

### Its a .lua script, using "Console Framework UE4SS" resources (OBRConsole) to execute the following console command when i open my save, only recommended to use it/install AFTER you get Shadowmere while doing Dark Brotherhood's questline:

------------------------------
### player.setownership(0x0c014fcb)
### shadowmere's id is 0x0c014fcb
------------------------------

### I dont know what would happen if you use it before finish the Dark Brotherhood's questline, so i advise to install it only if you finished it and you lost Shadowmere in game.

### Install instructions: Just drag the .zip file in your mod's manager
